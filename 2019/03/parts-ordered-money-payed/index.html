    <p>The first step to every project nowadays is ordering everything you need in order to plan and design while waiting for delivery. Due to a different location, we had to do some modifications to the list of parts, while we also tried to push the total cost of the project down a bit. This summarizes what we ordered and why, as well as how much it all cost.</p>

<h3 id="3d-printed-parts">3D printed parts</h3>

<p>The main idea of the author&rsquo;s open-source project was to replace an expensive metal framework with a cheap combination of 3D printed parts and standard aluminum extrusions. This choice not only lowers the cost, but also makes the parts more easily available while maintaining a high degree of customizibility.</p>

<p>Due to the experiences that the original author shared online, we can start by immediately printing all the parts from PETG, without doing a prototyping PLA print run first (thanks!). We have some advantages coming into the project, since we have a <strong>Prusa i3 MK3</strong> 3D printer available to us, which should be able to print all the required parts without melting in the process ;) <a href="LINK">TODO-LINK</a>.</p>

<p>By a random chance, we ended up buying three spools of PETG filament in Lithuania from an unknown (to us) brand of TODO-BRAND in gray color, trying to get as close as possible to the shade of the aluminum extrusions to keep a unified look of the rover.</p>

<h3 id="aluminum-extrusions">Aluminum extrusions</h3>

<p>Aluminum extrusions (profiles) are the main building block of this design and the author managed to obtain them from an american distributor of Misumi. This company was not willing to let us order anything from them since we were not a company, so we ended up ordering the extrusions on Aliexpress pre-cut to the required lengths for a grand total of $35. TODO: UPDATE UPON ARRIVAL While they are not the original proposed by the author and might have a slightly different cross-section, we are hoping that since the design uses 3D printed inserts, we could modify the design according to the parts we have ordered if the original design doesn&rsquo;t fit.</p>

<h3 id="electronics">Electronics</h3>

<p>We had a free <strong>Raspberry Pi 3</strong> lying around with all the required extensions, which helped a bit with lowering the budget. Apart from that, we ordered everything from Aliexpress. We will see if any choice comes back to bite us, since taxing of incoming packages is unpredictable (at least in Switzerland) and with Aliexpress being the jungle it is, you never quite know what you will get.</p>
